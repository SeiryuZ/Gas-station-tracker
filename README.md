Gas station finder
PROBLEM
One of the main concerns when driving cars is the fuel. Running out of fuel can be quite annoying, especially when you are in an unknown area. That is why it is crucial that we know where gas stations are stationed at. 

PROPOSED SOLUTION
A mobile app that knows the exact location of the nearest gas station. This allows the users who uses cars to travel without any worries of running out of gas in unknown lands. 

CORE FEATURES
-	Login / logout (Authentication)
-	Usage of location to find the nearest gas station to the user and the estimated time it takes to get there
-	Details on the gas station (facilities, gas availability)
-	Users can report if there are no gas available in a particular station or if there are any tricks involved in the gas filling

EXTERNAL SERVICE
The external services that are required in order for the app to work :
-	Google maps to find out the exact location of the gas station nearest from you

RELATED WORK
There are plenty other apps that can tell where gas stations are located such as Google maps, but this app is specifically used for finding gas stations. The app also tells the details, the facilities, and the availability of the gas in the station, something that are not present in any other apps.
